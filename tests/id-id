// We must explicitly instantiate polymorphic functions like `id` with the type
// that they act on. Below, the `id` on the right is instantiated to be a
// function `type -> type`. Consequently, the `id` on the left should take
// `(type -> type) -> (type -> type)`.
// The result will be the type of its argument, i.e. `type -> type`.

let id = (lambda t . (lambda x . x)) : (forall t : type) t -> t in
id (type -> type) (id type)
